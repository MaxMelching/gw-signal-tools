# gw_signal_tools

## Description

Repository with files surrounding computations with waveforms from lal.

## Installation

Since there is no lal-version for Python 3.12 yet, you have to install
Python 3.11, e.g. in a virtual or conda environment.

After that, either clone the repo to some destination and then navigate
there and run

```shell
pip install -e .
```

or run

```shell
pip install git+https://gitlab.aei.uni-hannover.de/fohme/gw-signal-tools.git
```

In case you have a SSH key pair, running

```shell
pip install git+ssh://git@gitlab.aei.uni-hannover.de/fohme/gw-signal-tools.git
```

is recommended.

## Project Status

In progress.
