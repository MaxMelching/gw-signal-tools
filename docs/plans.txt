General:
- provide links to useful gwisgnal doc pages, maybe on page about wf gen or so?

Inner Product:
- show that geometric units work
- show how to use frequency range arguments etc
- definitely mention that psd_no_noise has limited frequency range (but that
  one can insist on certain range, whence error is printed if this cannot
  be fulfilled with given input)
- show how overlap can be optimized

Fisher Matrix:
- show how to do stuff of common interest, for example accessing Fisher
- show example notebooks where we compute numerical Fisher and analytical
- show that giving params in dictionaries in SI values will also give
  derivatives in SI values (conversion in functions takes place anyway,
  but derivative functions divide by these values)
- mention that control over units in input dictionaries allows easy
  testing (and thus manual optimization) of Fisher w.r.t. condition number

Units:
- mention that custom units can be added via
  gw_signal_tools.units.def_unit('new_unit', ..., namespace=gw_signal_tools.units._ns)

  -> at least I think this is how it works; maybe adding to astropy.units is
     sufficient as well, test that when writing tutorial
  
  -> might also prevent errors in conversions
