    """
    Calculates the noise-weighted inner product of two signals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal1 : ~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries or
    ~gwpy.frequencyseries.FrequencySeries
        First signal
    signal2 : ~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries or
    ~gwpy.frequencyseries.FrequencySeries
        Second signal
    psd : ~gwpy.frequencyseries.FrequencySeries, optional,
    default = None
        Power spectral density to use in inner product. If None, it is taken
        to be 1 1/Hz at all frequencies.
    f_range : list[float] or list[~astropy.units.Quantity], optional,
    default = None
        Frequency range to compute inner product over. Is potentially
        cropped if bounds are greater than frequency range of one of the
        input signals.

        The whole argument can be None, otherwise it must have length 2.
        However, one of the bounds (or both) can still be None, which
        indicates that no boundary shall be set.
    df : float or ~astropy.units.Quantity, optional, default = None
        Distance df between samples in frequency domain to use in
        integration.
        If None, it is set to 0.0625 Hz (or whatever frequency unit is
        used in the signals), which is the default df of frequency
        domain waveforms generated by `~lalsimulation.gwsignal`.
    optimize_time_and_phase : bool, optional, default = False
        Determines if a match is computed or just a "regular" inner
        product. The match will be optimized over relative time and
        phase shifts between `signal1` and `signal2`.

    Returns
    -------
    ~astropy.units.Quantity or tuple[~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries,
    ~astropy.units.Quantity, ~astropy.units.Quantity]
        Inner product value with `signal1`, `signal2` inserted.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        In case either one of `signal1`, `signal2`, `psd` has wrong type.
    ValueError
        In case format of `f_range` parameter is not correct.

    See also

        Used to convert ``TimeSeries`` input to a ``FrequencySeries``.
    gwpy.frequencyseries.frequencyseries.interpolate :
        Function used to get signals to same sampling rate.
    
    Notes
    -----
    Some tips regarding the `df` parameter:
    (i) It should not be too large, otherwise results of the inner
    product may be erroneous.
    (ii) If chosen very small (e.g. in range of 0.001Hz), you should
    consider selecting only powers of two like 2**-10 Hz because these
    work best with certain function calls that utilize the Fourier
    transform of the involved signals. An indicator this might be
    necessary is a shape mismatch error.
